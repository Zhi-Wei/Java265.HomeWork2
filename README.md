* Problem 4: Depth-first search (DFS). First download the maze game [here](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~d00922011/java/266/maze/Maze.zip). (You can unzip the jar file by using 7zip, WinRAR, and other unzip softwares.) Then take a look at the demo clip [here](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~d00922011/java/266/maze/demo.html). Now implement the agent method which determines a path starting from the origin to the goal by using DFS algorithm to explore the maze world. The agent method can be found in Maze.java which is the only java source code you should read carefully. You may use drawBlueDot(int x, int y) and drawGrayDot(int x, int y) to put the blue dots and gray dots, respectively. If you are interested in searching algorithms, try BFS (breadth first search) and A* search.

* Problem 5: MyPolynomial Class. Follow the definition of MyPolynomial, as shown below.

Write a test program which creates two MyPolynomial objects and demonstrates all MyPolynomial methods. For example, the program outputs the results as follows:

Feel free to add more methods related to polynomials.
